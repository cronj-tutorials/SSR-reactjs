# What is SSR ? #

According to Redux Team: 
	
	The most common use case for server-side rendering is to handle 
	the initial render when a user (or search engine crawler) 
	first requests our app. When the server receives the 
	request, it renders the required component(s) into 
	an HTML string, and then sends it as a response to
	the client. From that point on, the client takes 
	over rendering dutie.
